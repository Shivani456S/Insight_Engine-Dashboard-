#Design decisions or assumptions

Used Alatair Charts instead of Streamlit Charts for sorting data and applying custom color schemes.
Used Plotly Express library for line plots instead of Streamlit Line plots for further customisation options.
Used Mapbox library for a responsive and better looking map plot.
Used third party Geojson data for accurate map plotting.
Webapp divided into different segments for different analysis.
Specific filters are segregated according to each section of analysis.
Used a custom footer component available in Streamlit community, due to no footer component in streamlit documentation.
