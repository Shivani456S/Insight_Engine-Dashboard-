## **Design Decisions or Assumptions**

- *Used Altair Charts* instead of Streamlit Charts for sorting data and applying custom color schemes.
- *Used Plotly Express* for line plots to enable advanced customization options.
- *Mapbox library* was utilized for responsive and visually appealing map plots.
- *Third-party GeoJSON data* was incorporated for accurate geographical representations.
- Web app divided into segmented views for focused analysis.
- Specific filters were segregated based on each section of the analysis.
- A custom footer component from the Streamlit community was implemented, as Streamlit does not natively support footers.
